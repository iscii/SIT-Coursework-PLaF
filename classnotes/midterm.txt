MIDTERM Notes
- ON MIDTERM: Know how to derive an expression. 
   - Read Inductive Notes/Definitions chapter
   - Add derivations to cheatsheet**
- ON MIDTERM: Know the result of a debug() call
   - What vars are in env at time of call
   - procs in proc are not ProcVals because they aren't yet evaluated. they're 
      just Proc(...) and all the other Abstract Syntax in the proc expression.
- Concrete syntax vs abstract syntax
   - Concrete: z-x
   - Abstract: Sub(Var "z", Var "x")
- Do exercises (3.4.3-9, etc..)


Midterm
5 exercises:
- Derivation
- Result of evaluating code in PROC 
- Result of evaluating code in REC 
- debug question (typically in REC). 
- Simple extension to LET.
    a. The homework pertains to this question
    b. code the interpreter
    c. example: extend with record, trees, etc
    d. we are not asked to write evaluation rules, if asked to write a derivation 
       we will always be given the evaluation rules
    e. won't be asked to write an evaluation rule for a new program/feature
Midterm rules:
- test is 1 hour and a half,
- pencil and paper,
- 1 cheat sheet write OR PRINT on both sides, font as small as u want 
- no laptop or phone
